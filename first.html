        <p>ComicKult is an upcoming portal for the comic community. They announced with an incredibly slick launching soon page that we featured and awarded "Most Loved"" earlier this month.</p>
        <p>The unique One Pager features an impressive comic book cover "tiled waterfall"" background (demo'd further down). There is so much attention to detail from cover Retina optimization to sign up form button animations.</p>
        <p>I got hold of the team to find out more about the design, the build and the brand. We rapped about first impressions, obstacles, development tools, inspiration, MVPs and of course comics!</p>
        <p>Hope you enjoy the interview:)</p>

     <h2>Yo Derek! Yo Ugreson! Yo Sean! To start can you tell One Page Love readers where you are from and what keeps you busy?</h2>

        <p><strong>Sean:</strong> My home base is currently London, where I get to engage with the awesomely dynamic culture that a "world"" city creates. It's been entirely awesome on both a personal and professional level. Lately the London development community have been hitting whole new levels in the international standings. I am exceedingly lucky to be so close to some of the brightest minds in the industry, so I make a concerted effort to engage via meet-ups and shared workspaces such as Google Campus. This and my love of open source have really allowed me to push my boundaries as a developer.</p>
        <p>I’ve also moved in the remote contracting world, which adds another layer of flexibility to my life. Besides being a geek I am also a blessed father, so being able to hang out with the little one is just a treat.</p>

        <p><strong>Derek:</strong> Aweh, I'm from and currently based in beautiful Cape Town, "I live out there, so don't go there." I've also recently joined the world of funemployment. Apart from this project, I have a few side projects on the go taking up my time while I wait for Sean to stop traveling to Bali and actually get our MVP off the ground :P</p>
        <p>Ugreson, aka, Mais, the third partner in our ComicKult trio is probably the most obsessed with comics since back in the day. He is an intellectual property lawyer based in Munich and his passion for comics and legal background has been important in the creation process. Recently we roped him into channelling the uber nerd onto our social media sites with his "ShelfPorn".</p>

    <h2>Good to meet you all. So ComicKult took us all by surprise with this killer Launching Soon page. How long has ComicKult been in the pipeline?</h2>

        <p><strong>Derek:</strong> Phew, I think for us it didn't come out of nowhere, we've been in the conceptual phase for quite some time now (won't say how long, but I completely blame Sean.) In the last few months we've really got the ball rolling in a big way. Sean actually pitched the ComicKult idea to me probably more than 2 years ago, shortly after that I met Mais (the Godfather of everything comic related), we instantly hit it off, now we've finally got the holding page done, and working hard on MVP.</p>
